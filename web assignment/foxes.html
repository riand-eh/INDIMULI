        <h1>Bat-eared Fox</h1>
        <p>
            The bat-eared fox is another Kenyan animal that belongs to the dog family. Its large ears are its defining characteristic. These ears not only give the fox its name but also provide excellent hearing, helping it detect its primary prey—termites and other insects. Unlike other foxes, the bat-eared fox has six more teeth, an adaptation believed to be linked to its insect-based diet.
        </p>
        <p>
            These foxes can be found in savannahs, arid scrublands, and grassy plains. They inhabit regions such as Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, Angola, and Zimbabwe. Socially, they may live alone or in small groups, depending on their habitat and resource availability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Classified by the IUCN as least concern, bat-eared foxes have a stable population. However, threats such as hunting, disease, and drought pose challenges to their continued survival in some regions.
